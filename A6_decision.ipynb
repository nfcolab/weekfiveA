    "We start with creating a decision making agent, who's task is to conduct visual search over the UI elements and based on information in them (text or colours), decide whether to accept or reject a transaction. Training an agent takes some time, and we can then use the trained agent for simulations. The agent only needs retraining if the UI changes, or if some parameters are changed. So, generally it's a good idea to train agents in a separate cell, and then use another cell to use the agent for analysis."
